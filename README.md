 ## Abstract
 Mobile robots at present are used extensively in the industrial and commercial sectors. There is a need for a robot that can easily
maneuver in the sparse space at the warehouse, stores, etc. Omnidirectional robots have an upper hand over conventional mobile robots as
they need not change their orientation while maneuvering. In this paper,
we are putting forth the design of robust controller for Omni Wheeled
Mobile Robot(OWMR). In the beginning, Kinematic and Dynamic modeling of OWMR was done, then PID and Sliding Mode Controller(SMC)
were implemented on the OWMR. The proposed controller tracks the
trajectory with greater accuracy as compared to other standard controllers.
